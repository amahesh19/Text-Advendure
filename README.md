# text-based game engine

This project is a game engine for text-based games.
It allows people to easily create and play text based games.

So far, it allows game creators to write stories, and plays the stories out, keeping track of checkpoints and user input.
This allows game creators to make adventures similar to choose your own adventure novels, but with much more room for choice, and without all that pesky flipping from page to page by the user.


In the future, we could add support for different data types, such as integers or floats, in order to support adding different
add-ons, such as turn based combat, or other game elements requiring numbers. 
We also have an interest in adding a better UI, as well as save-files.

We made this software for the "Hack the Class" Hackathon at the University of Alberta, which was hosted by the Student's Innovation Centre.

To demo this software, you can download the "demo" folder and follow the following steps:

1) Download the demo folder
2) Go to the demo folder using the command line
3) Type "java -jar textAdventure.java" (no quotes) and hit enter
4) Type the name of the game file you want to run (type "fishingGame.json"  with no quotes for this demo)
5) Enjoy!
